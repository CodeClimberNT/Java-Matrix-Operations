# My personal Matrix Operations project

---

Sometimes i need to use some matrix for some exercise but I don't want to learn how to add external library, so I decided to make my *personal* library to avoid me to repeat the same code every time.

Feel free to use it, suggest some improvement and more!

## *I will prioritize adding new functionality than optimize the performace*

Remember I'm a student trying to learn some code ðŸ˜œ
That means that all the suggestion and help will be appreciate!
